# 🎧 Spotify Listening Insights Dashboard

This Power BI dashboard was built for the **Maven Analytics January 2025 Challenge**, where the goal was to uncover insights from personal Spotify listening history.

## 🧠 Objective
To analyze listening behavior over time — identifying patterns in track plays, top artists, listening hours, and skipped content — to visualize media engagement trends.

## 📂 Dataset
- `spotify_history.csv`: Raw listening history
- `spotify_data_dictionary.csv`: Field definitions
- ~2,500 rows, timestamped logs of music playback

## 📊 Key Features
- KPI Cards: Total plays, unique artists, average duration
- Heatmaps: Listening activity by hour/day
- Top Tracks & Artists: Dynamic bar charts
- Time Trends: Monthly listening pattern & engagement spikes
- Skipped Songs: Detection of partial plays

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Power BI (Desktop)
- DAX for calculated columns & measures
- Power Query for data shaping & timestamp conversion
